# Advance Flutter Ch-1


## 1.1 Theme change

In Flutter, themes are used to control the appearance of your app.Flutter provides two built-in themes: LightTheme and DarkTheme. You can further customize these themes or create your own custom themes.
This Flutter project demonstrates how to implement theme switching between light and dark themes.

 ## 1.4 Provider & Change Theme using Provider

The Provider package, created by Remi Rousselet, aims to handle the state as cleanly as possible. In Provider, widgets listen to changes in the state and update as soon as they are notified.
Provider State Management, which is recommended by Google as well, mainly provides you with a central point to manage the state, and to write front-end logic.
A provider is a third-party library. Here, we need to understand three main concepts to use this library.
